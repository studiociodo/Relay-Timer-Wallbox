# Relay-Timer-Wallbox
Instead of using app fot everything I have create a timer to manage charge my Car like a dishwasher
For starting my wallbox to charging the car, I made a timer that you can set the dalay time before start and duration of time of a relay that control my wallbox instead of using apps to make more immediate to use.
By default is delay 0 and duration 12 hours (for immedialy start), but with pressing of relative buttons you can set delay from 0 to 12 hours and duration from 1 to 12 hours.
